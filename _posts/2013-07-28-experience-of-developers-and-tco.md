It is not uncommon to find a manager hiring junior software developer to reduce the cost of development. But, are they really cost effective? We don't think so. By juniors, we mean someone who is less skilled and has not worked in industry for long. Senior developers are those who have more skills or have acquired skills through work experience.



Junior developers take more time to finish the work and it needs someone to closely review their work which demands some time from other developers. Their skills can be polished by regular training session but any such training is not free of cost because either you have to hire an external trainer or dedicate some time of senior team member.

Generally, senior developers are well skilled to finish their work on time and their work need less review. Their code quality is better and maintainable for long time. They are two or three times more productive than their peer junior developers.  If we calculate logically then is not very hard to find that actually senior developers are more cost effective.
